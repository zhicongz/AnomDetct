Description: Detect embedded clusters in a given continuous distributed sample. The cluster can be either a fix point cluster or a cluster with small variance. The underlying distribution, cluster locations and cluster size are not necessary to be specified. The math work is shown in a paper written by Jonathan Woody, Tung-Lung Wu and Zhicong Zhao, which is going to be submitted soon. The numeric approximation of scan statistics is from 1-dependent stationary sequences (Haiman 2007) <doi:10.1016/j.jspi.2006.06.010>.
